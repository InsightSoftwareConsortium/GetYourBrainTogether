# Welcome to the 1st Get Your Brain Straight Hackathon !

## What?

The **Get Your Brain Straight** hackathons **bring together neuroimage data
generators, image registration researchers, and neurodata compute
infrastructure providers for a hands-on, collaborative event**. This community
collaboration aims to **create reproducible, open source resources** that enable
discovery of the structure and function of brains.

There are three components to the hackathon.
First, the primary goal of each hackathon is the generation of a **Reproducible Resource** for registration and analysis of
a specific brain imaging modality.
**Tutorial** sessions share how to work with open source registration tools, open access datasets, or neurodata
archives.
**Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) Breakout** sessions enable participants
interested in collaborating to work on relevant topics.

**Example ways to participate:**

* [Contribute a registration pipeline resource](https://insightsoftwareconsortium.github.io/GetYourBrainStraight/HCK01_2022_Virtual/#reproducible-resource-challenge) that can be deployed on Brain Imaging Library (BIL) resources to register the challenge dataset.
* [Give a tutorial](https://insightsoftwareconsortium.github.io/GetYourBrainStraight/HCK01_2022_Virtual/#tutorials) about your registration tools. A pre-recorded or live presentation, along with example code and recipes, can teach a data analyst how to run your tool and use the output on the challenge dataset and/or another open dataset.
* [Come and learn](https://insightsoftwareconsortium.github.io/GetYourBrainStraight/HCK01_2022_Virtual/#birds-of-a-feather-breakouts) about registration from experts in the field.

## Reproducible Resource Challenge

This aim of this hackathon is to generate reproducible pipelines to register whole-brain microscopy
image data to the [CCFv3](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.007). Two datasets are provided,
each with their unique quirks. You may work on either dataset during the hackathon.

In order to work with the neuroimage data generators, these pipelines will take a standardized input
without assumptions of directory structures, filenames, etc and generate standardized outputs.
Expected outputs include: resampled brain, spatial transformation, and a manifest of outputs. The
processing pipelines should be designed to executed in independently in parallel. The output should
be a resampled image with the same size, orientation, and origin as the provided CCFv3. The output
should include an affine transformation file, and a deformation field transformation file to
transform SWC and/or annotation files from the challenge dataset image space into the CCFv3 space.

Criteria for inclusion in a summary paper:

- [ ] Open source with an [OSI-approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses)
    - The code can be executed in the future
    - Researchers can understand what the code is doing
    - Researchers can extend or fix as needed
- Works on open standard data formats used by data providers and consumers
    - [ ] The provided input NIFTI or OME-NGFF images
    - [ ] Provide outputs in open standard formats on the BIL at `/hackathon/2022_GYBS/output/<team-name>/<dataset>/*`.
- Deployable
    - Can be executed across many environments
    - [ ] Provided in a
      published [singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/2.6/user-guide/introduction.html) image
- [ ] Can be executed by an independent analyst on the BIL

The primary goals for this hackathon is to ensure that everyone's code can run on the dataset
provided and can be replicated.

In future hackathons, we will focus on:

- Combine registration results and methods
- Quantification and characterization of deformation patterns in fMOST imaging
- Identify biologically relevant regions where improvements need to be made
- Focus on accuracy quantification leading to potential improvements

### Challenge Dataset 1: fMOST Mouse Brain Registration to CCFv3

The fMOST brain volumes and CCFv3 atlas for the hackathon are
available [on the BIL here](https://download.brainlib.org/hackathon/2022_GYBS/input/fMOST/). The input is a
single fMOST NIFTI brain volume. Details about this dataset can be found [here](./Tutorials/fMOSTIntroduction).

### Challenge Dataset 2: Light-Sheet Imaged Mouse Brain Registration to CCFv3

The Light-sheet imaged brain volumes are available
[on the BIL here](https://download.brainlib.org/hackathon/2022_GYBS/input/lightsheet/). For this challenge
set, the data and atlas is provided for a single brain hemisphere (for size considerations and to
mimic most real world experiments). Multiple data replicates are provided. We provide one
dataset `subject0.zarr` in full imaging resolution for those seeking a bigger challenge. As a
convenience we provide the challenge sets at approximately atlas size as
Nifti(`subjectN_25.nii.gz`)
or [OME-NGFF](`subjectN_25.nii.gz`) (`subjectN_25.zarr`). Participants may use either format but
OME-NGFF is preferred because it allows more efficient memory usage for larger datasets.

Details on working with the data can be found 
[here](./Tutorials/MappingLightSheetData/AboutTheDatasets.md)

## Birds-of-a-Feather Breakouts

Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) breakout sessions enable participants
interested in collaborating to work on relevant topics.

To lead or join a Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) breakout session, create or join a
topic [in this
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uthoU0CbY-sN5e4neY70IsHKPPXkR21fkcamMDJtmrg/edit#gid=0).
During the BoF, find the leader by clicking on their name in the [Image.sc Island Gather.Town](https://j.mp/imagesc-island) and moving towards their avatar with the keyboard arrow keys. When you are close to their avatar in the virtual space, you will be able to see, hear, and talk to each other.

If notes are taken during the BoF, please add them to the [BoF breakouts
folder](./BoFBreakouts). We recommend [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) for collaborative,
well-formatted notetaking.
