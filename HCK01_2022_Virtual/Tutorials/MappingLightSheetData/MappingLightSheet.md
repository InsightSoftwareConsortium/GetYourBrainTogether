# Registering Cleared Tissues

## Instructors

## Tutorial Description

Light-sheet fluorescence imaging of cleared tissue provides an accessible yet powerful means for
researchers to obtain brain-wide snapshots at sub-cellular resolution. As a rapidly growing
technique, tissue clearing has provided us with insights into disease pathology, vascular
patterning, and brain region function.

Tissue clearing is often used as an unbiased tool to screen for patterns across all regions of the
brain. This necessitates accurate registration across all brain regions. With Light-sheet imaging,
labs can generate cellular resolution snapshots in as little as 20min or high magnification
snapshots in as little as 2 hours. Therefore, registration techniques must be fast yet accurate.

In this tutorial, we will discuss the theory behind light-sheet fluorescence imaging and tissue
clearing. We will then discuss how we can use analysis and registration tools to go from raw image
data to regionalized quantification. Along this journey, we will go over common artifacts present in
datasets and how these artifacts can affect registration.

The goal of this tutorial is for students to understand how registration fits into the light-sheet
imaging workflow, the limits of current registration tools, and how we can begin to generate a next 
generation of registration tools for light-sheet imaging data.
