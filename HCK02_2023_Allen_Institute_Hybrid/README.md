# Welcome to the web page for the 2nd Get Your Brain Together Hackathon !

## What?

The **Get Your Brain Together** hackathons **bring together neuroimage data
generators, image registration researchers, and neurodata compute
infrastructure providers for a hands-on, collaborative event**. This community
collaboration aims to **create reproducible, open source resources** that enable
discovery of the structure and function of brains.

There are three components to the hackathon.
First, the primary goal of each hackathon is the generation of a **Reproducible Resource** for registration and analysis of
a specific brain imaging modality.
**Tutorial** sessions share how to work with open source registration tools, open access datasets, or neurodata
archives.
**Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) Breakout** sessions enable participants
interested in collaborating to work on relevant topics.

**Example ways to participate:**

* [Contribute a registration pipeline resource](https://insightsoftwareconsortium.github.io/GetYourBrainTogether/HCK01_2022_Virtual/#reproducible-resource-challenge) to register the challenge datasets.
* [Give a tutorial](https://insightsoftwareconsortium.github.io/GetYourBrainTogether/HCK01_2022_Virtual/#tutorials) about your registration tools. A pre-recorded or live presentation, along with example code and recipes, can teach a data analyst how to run your tool and use the output on the challenge dataset and/or another open dataset.
* [Come and learn](https://insightsoftwareconsortium.github.io/GetYourBrainTogether/HCK01_2022_Virtual/#birds-of-a-feather-breakouts) about registration from experts in the field.

## How does it work?

### Before the Hackathon

- Register for the event.
- Sign up for the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/brain_straight_hackathon_announcements).
- Optionally prepare a tutorial or organize a Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) Breakout.

### During the Hackathon

The week will start 9 AM Pacific Time, 12 AM Eastern Time, Monday, May 22nd
in an introductory all-hands videoconference.

Following the introduction, participate in the Reproducible Resource
Challenge, join the tutorials, and participate BoF breakouts. Please bring a laptop.

At the end of the day on Tuesday, participants will delegate one member to present their registration processing pipelines, results, and discuss lessons learned.

## Who can attend?

Get Your Brain Together hackathons are open to all and publicly advertised. Email announcements are sent to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/brain_straight_hackathon_announcements).

## Code of Conduct
