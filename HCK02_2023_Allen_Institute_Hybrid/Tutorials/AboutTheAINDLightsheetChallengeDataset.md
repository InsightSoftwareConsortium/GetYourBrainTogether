# About the AIND Lightsheet Challenge Dataset

## Instructors

- David Feng (Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics)
- Sharmishtaa Seshamani (Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics)
- Tom Birdsong (Kitware)

## Tutorial Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the tutorial and duration. Recommended
durations is 0.5 hours. -->

In this tutorial, we will share information about lightsheet microscopy data
collected at the Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics and how to run a
reproducible reference registration pipeline in CodeOcean.

Duration: 0.5 hours.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Understand how the AIND lightsheet volumes are created.
2. Learn about driving neurophysiological problems.
3. Identify challenges for registration of the dataset.
3. Learn how to run a reference registration pipeline on the dataset in CodeOcean.
