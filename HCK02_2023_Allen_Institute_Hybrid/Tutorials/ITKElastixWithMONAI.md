# Tutorial: itk-elastix and MONAI

## Instructors

- Konstantinos Ntatsis (Leiden University Medical Center)

## Tutorial Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the tutorial and duration. Recommended
durations is 0.5 hours. -->

The tutorial will be about itk-elastix, a python wrapping of the elastix registration framework. 
We will demonstrate how to register and transform (brain) images, and how itk-elastix can
be used together with the medical deep learning library MONAI.

Duration: 0.5 hours.

## Learning Outcomes

<!-- Describe here what you would like participants to learn by the end of the tutorial. -->

1. Outcome 1. Use itk-elastix to register and transform brain images
2. Outcome 2. Find additional documentation, example notebooks and parameter file zoo 
3. Outcome 3. Bridge images and transforms between ITK/Elastix and MONAI
