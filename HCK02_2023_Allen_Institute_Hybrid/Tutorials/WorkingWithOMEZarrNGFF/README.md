# Working with OME-Zarr NGFF

## Instructors

- Matt McCormick (Kitware)

## Tutorial Description

The Open Microscopy Environment (OME) organization has long guided the
bioimaging community in the establishment of open standard formats such as
OME-TIFF. Recently, the [Zarr](https://zarr.dev/) format emerged as an
underlying format for multi-dimensional scientific arrays + metadata that is
compatible with the modern, cloud-based computing ecosystem. Furthermore, this
format addresses the scalability needs for large-scale microscopy volumes
generated by state-of-the-art systems.

Neuroimaging community standards such as Microscopy-BIDS, and BRAIN Initiative
archives, such as BIL and DANDI, are working on adoption of the format. A
suite of visualization and analysis tools are evolving to support the format.

This tutorial provides a basic, working understanding the structure of OME-Zarr and
explains how this relates to findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable
(FAIR) objectives.

Duration: 0.5 hours.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Outcome 1. Understand the structure of the OME-Zarr format.
2. Outcome 2. Understand how an OME-Zarr image can provide the same interface but be stored in multiple different backend storage systems.
3. Outcome 3. Learn how to read pixel values and image metadata from an OME-Zarr volume.
4. Outcome 4. Learn how to visualize OME-Zarr volumes with web-based visualization tools.
