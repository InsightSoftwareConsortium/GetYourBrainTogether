# Welcome to the web page for the 3nd Get Your Brain Together Hackathon !

## What?

The **Get Your Brain Together** hackathons **bring together neuroimage data
generators, image registration researchers, and neurodata compute
infrastructure providers for a hands-on, collaborative event**. This community
collaboration aims to **create reproducible, open source resources** that enable
discovery of the structure and function of brains.

There are three components to the hackathon.

1. **Tutorial** sessions share how to work with open source registration tools, open access datasets, or neurodata
archives.
2. **Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) Breakout** sessions enable participants
interested in collaborating to work on relevant topics.
3. Each hackathon generates a **Reproducible Resource** for registration and
   analysis of neuroimaging datasets.
