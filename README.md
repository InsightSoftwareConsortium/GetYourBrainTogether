## Introduction

#### What?

The **Get Your Brain Together** hackathons bring together neuroimage data
generators, image registration researchers, and neurodata compute
infrastructure providers for a hands-on, collaborative event. This community
collaboration aims to create reproducible, open source resources that enable
discovery of the structure and function of brains.

#### What is the history of the hackathons?

This hackathon is inspired by and based on the successful [NeurodataWithoutBorders (NWB)](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/nwb_hackathons/) and [NA-MIC Project Week](https://projectweek.na-mic.org/) hackathons.
